# Deep-Learning-Deployment

This repository contains a growing collection of AI projects focused on model deployment. The projects cover a wide spectrum of areas such as regression-based predictions, image classification, natural language processing (NLP), and time series analysis. Expect a significant number of new projects to be published in the coming week, as there are many currently in the pipeline.

My main goal here is not only to showcase diverse deployment strategies but also to create a platform for knowledge sharing, education, and idea exchange within the AI community.

## Deployment Strategies

The AI models in this repository have been deployed using several robust strategies:

- **FastAPI/Flask**: FastAPI and Flask, being lightweight web frameworks, play a crucial role in creating RESTful APIs. The projects herein demonstrate how these frameworks can be used to present the trained models as APIs.

- **Docker**: Docker aids in containerizing the AI models along with their dependencies, thus promising consistent deployment across varied environments. The projects provide guidance on how Docker can be used to containerize the models.

- **Google Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform offers a suitable environment for deploying the AI models on the cloud. Our projects illustrate how to exploit Google Cloud services to host and manage the deployed models.

## Contributions

We actively encourage contributions to this repository! If you're keen to add your own AI deployment projects or refine the existing ones, don't hesitate to submit a pull request. Let's collaborate to make AI more accessible, understandable, and beneficial for all.
